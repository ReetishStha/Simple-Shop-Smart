How to Set Up and Run ShopSmart Project Locally:

1. Set Up Maven Wrapper:
   First, navigate to your project’s root directory in the terminal, then run the following command to generate the Maven wrapper:
   mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper

2. Build the Project:
   Once the Maven wrapper is set up, run the following command to clean and install the project:
   .\mvnw clean install
   - This will compile and package your project into a .war file. The .war file will be located in the target/ folder of your project.

3. Install Apache Tomcat (If Not Installed):
   Download Apache Tomcat version 10.1.40 (or your preferred version) from the official link:
   - Tomcat 10.1.40 ZIP Download (https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.1.40/bin/apache-tomcat-10.1.40-windows-x64.zip)

4. Extract the Tomcat ZIP File:
   - After downloading, extract the ZIP file to a directory of your choice. For example, C:\apache-tomcat-10.1.40\.

5. Deploy Your WAR File:
   - After extraction, open the webapps/ folder in your Tomcat directory.
   - Copy the .war file you generated in Step 2 from your project’s target/ folder and paste it into the webapps/ folder of the Tomcat directory.

6. Navigate to the Tomcat bin/ Folder:
   - Go to the bin/ folder inside the Tomcat directory:
     - C:\apache-tomcat-10.1.40\bin\

7. Start Apache Tomcat:
   - Open a terminal or Command Prompt in this folder.
   - Run the following command to start Tomcat:
     .\startup.bat

8. Access the Application in Your Browser:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the following URL:
     - http://localhost:8080/shopsmart-1.0-SNAPSHOT
   - This will bring up the ShopSmart application hosted locally on your machine.

Troubleshooting Tips:
- If Tomcat fails to start, check for any errors in the terminal or the logs/ directory inside the Tomcat folder.
- Make sure that port 8080 is not being used by another application. If it is, you can change the port in the conf/server.xml file of Tomcat.
- If the .war file is not deploying, ensure that the file is named correctly and located in the webapps/ folder.
